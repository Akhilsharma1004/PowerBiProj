# PowerBiProj
The AdventureWorks database, a well-structured sample dataset provided by Microsoft, simulates a real-world business scenario with sales, customer, product, and employee data. By leveraging Power BI’s data modeling, visualization, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) capabilities, this project demonstrates how to clean, transform, and analyze data effectively.

This practice project covers all fundamental aspects needed for mastering Power BI, including:
✅ Data Import & Transformation (Power Query)
✅ Data Modeling & Relationships
✅ DAX Calculations for Insights
✅ Interactive Dashboards & Reports
✅ Business-Centric Visualizations & KPIs
